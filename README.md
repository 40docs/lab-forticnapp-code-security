# üîê Code Security Demo: FortiCNAPP

In this lab, you'll explore a deliberately vulnerable codebase containing hardcoded secrets, outdated dependencies, insecure Docker configs, and misconfigured infrastructure-as-code. These represent common real-world mistakes.

You'll see how **Lacework FortiCNAPP** provides deep visibility into these risks through:

- Automated code scanning
- Detailed vulnerability findings
- Secrets detection
- SmartFix & AutoFix suggestions
- CI/CD policy enforcement (e.g., blocking PRs)

By the end, you‚Äôll learn how to detect, remediate, and prevent security issues before they reach runtime.

### üìÑ `app/app.py`

```python
from flask import Flask
from config import AWS_SECRET_KEY

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return f"Secret: {AWS_SECRET_KEY}"  # ‚ùå Secret exposed in HTTP response

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)  # ‚ùå No TLS, runs in dev mode
```

> **What FortiCNAPP detects**: Secret usage in code flow, use of insecure default server, lack of environment-based config.

---

### üìÑ `app/config.py`

```python
AWS_SECRET_KEY = 'AKIAFAKEKEYEXAMPLE123456'  # ‚ùå Hardcoded AWS secret key
```

> **What FortiCNAPP detects**: Credential pattern match (high confidence), flagged as exposed secret.

---

### üìÑ `app/requirements.txt`

```txt
flask==1.0            # ‚ùå CVE-2018-1000656
requests==2.19.1      # ‚ùå CVE-2018-18074
pyyaml==4.2b1         # ‚ùå CVE-2017-18342
django==1.11.27       # ‚ùå Multiple CVEs incl. RCE
urllib3==1.24.1       # ‚ùå CVE-2019-11324
jinja2==2.10          # ‚ùå CVE-2019-10906
pillow==6.2.1         # ‚ùå CVE-2020-10177
```

> **What FortiCNAPP detects**: Software Composition Analysis (SCA) matches against known CVEs. Provides CVSS scores, remediation paths (SmartFix), and upgrade suggestions.

---

### üìÑ `Dockerfile`

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.8

WORKDIR /app

COPY app/ .

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt  # ‚ùå Installs known-vulnerable packages

EXPOSE 5000

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

> ‚ùå No non-root user  
> ‚ùå No runtime user constraints  
> ‚ùå No multi-stage build or scan layers  
> ‚ùå No healthcheck  

> **What FortiCNAPP detects**: Insecure container build practices, base image risk (if known CVEs exist in `python:3.8`), missing best practices.

---

### üìÑ `terraform/s3-public.tf`

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "public_bucket" {
  bucket = "forticnapp-demo-bucket"
  acl    = "public-read"  # ‚ùå Publicly readable bucket
}
```

> **What FortiCNAPP detects**: Misconfigured IaC (exposed resources), flagging policy violations for public cloud services.
