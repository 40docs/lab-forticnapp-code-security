# üîê Code Security Demo: FortiCNAPP

This is an **educational security lab** designed to demonstrate common code vulnerabilities and how **Lacework FortiCNAPP** detects and helps remediate them. The repository contains intentionally vulnerable code that represents real-world security mistakes.

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: This code contains deliberate security vulnerabilities for educational purposes only. **Never deploy this code to production environments.**

## What You'll Learn

Through hands-on experience with **Lacework FortiCNAPP**, you'll discover how to:

* **Detect vulnerabilities** across multiple security domains
* **Understand scan types**: IaC, SAST, SCA, and Secrets scanning
* **Remediate issues** using SmartFix automated suggestions
* **Integrate security** into CI/CD workflows and PR reviews
* **Prevent security debt** before code reaches production

## Vulnerability Categories

This lab demonstrates **4 key security domains** that FortiCNAPP addresses:

| Domain | Description | Examples in This Lab |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Secrets** | Hardcoded credentials and API keys | AWS credentials in config files |
| **SAST** | Application security flaws | SQL injection, command injection, weak crypto |
| **SCA** | Vulnerable dependencies | Outdated packages with known CVEs |
| **IaC** | Infrastructure misconfigurations | Public S3 buckets, insecure networking |

## üéØ Expected Scan Results

When you run FortiCNAPP scans, you should discover:

### Secrets Detection
- ‚úÖ Hardcoded AWS access key in `app/config.py`
- ‚úÖ Exposed credentials via Flask route responses

### SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
- ‚úÖ **SQL Injection**: Direct string concatenation in database queries
- ‚úÖ **Command Injection**: Unsanitized user input to `os.system()`
- ‚úÖ **Weak Cryptography**: MD5 hashing for password storage
- ‚úÖ **Missing Error Handling**: Potential information disclosure

### SCA (Software Composition Analysis)
- ‚úÖ **8 vulnerable packages** with known CVEs:
  - Flask 1.0 (CVE-2018-1000656)
  - Django 1.11.27 (Multiple CVEs)
  - Requests 2.19.1 (CVE-2018-18074)
  - And 5 additional vulnerable dependencies

### IaC (Infrastructure as Code)
- ‚úÖ **Public S3 Bucket**: Configured with public-read ACL
- ‚úÖ **Public Subnet**: Auto-assigns public IPs to instances
- ‚úÖ **Missing Encryption**: No server-side encryption configured
